                 formats and methods for binary and decimal
                 floating-point arithmetic in computer programming
                 environments. This standard specifies exception
                 conditions and their default handling. An
                 implementation of a floating-point system conforming to
                 this standard may be realized entirely in software,
                 entirely in hardware, or in any combination of software
                 and hardware. For operations specified in the normative
                 part of this standard, numerical results and exceptions
                 are uniquely determined by the values of the input
                 data, sequence of operations, and destination formats,
                 all under user control.",
